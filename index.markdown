2. **Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other** - A groundbreaking book by one of the most important thinkers of our time shows how technology is warping our social lives and our inner ones.

But this relentless connection leads to a deep solitude. MIT professor Sherry Turkle argues that as technology ramps up, our emotional lives ramp down. Based on hundreds of interviews and with a new introduction taking us to the present day, Alone Together describes changing, unsettling relationships between friends, lovers, and families.
